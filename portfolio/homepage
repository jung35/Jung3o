<h3>My Homepage</h3>

<p>If you didn't already know, this is the design of my main site. I don't exactly have a date when I made this, but I made it. I designed it out of scratch only with photoshop and Sublime Text 2. I also used icomoon to get my icons from.</p>

<p>In this site, I used jQuery to do some ~hacky~ things in my website. You can goto my GitHub repository at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jung3o/Jung3o">https://github.com/jung3o/Jung3o</a></p>
