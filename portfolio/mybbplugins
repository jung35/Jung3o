<h3>MyBB Plugins</h3>
<p>I have made MyBB plugins just as a start of making forum plugins in general. I've heard that MyBB plugin development is really easy, so I thought I'd try it out.</p>
<p>So far I've made 4 plugins and they're all working fine. Just one of them needs special attention to it because you need to add a line of code after installing it.</p>

<p>I base my plugins off of the default MyBB forum theme. I've tested multiple times and it has always worked. The names of pluggins are <u>Rate Me a Funny</u>, <u>Minecraft Premium User</u>, <u>Many New Posts</u>, and <u>Post Preset Replies</u>.</p>

<h4>Rate Me a Funny</h4>
<p>This lets you rate each user in a postbit. You can edit which kinds of ratings are avaiable where and which groups can use it. you can also edit where it’s not avaliable and which groups cannot use it. there’s even an option if people can multirate (but this option doesn’t exist for groups or forum. It’s global)<br>
<b>This is a plugin that requires munual editing to add in the plugin!</b><br>

<h4>Minecraft Premium User</h4>
<p>This is my first ever created plugin for MyBB. Someone wanted me to make a plugin for MyBB where a tool can verify if a user has a premium account. This plugin then switches the user to a “minecraft group” or if the administrator changed the group to something else. Then, it will switch the user to the different group.
This plugin might not be very secure, but the users in the forum has to believe that their adminitrator isn’t trying to steal their account.</p>

<h4>Many New Posts</h4>
<p>This plugin shows how many new posts have been made since the last time the user saw it. The user can also just click on the box that is showing the amount of posts made and it will direct the user to the first post made ever since the user saw the thread. This will expire based on forum settings on how long til the thread title highlight expires.
This plugin is final. I will not add anything new to it.</p>

<h4>Post Preset Replies</h4>
<p>This plugin allows members of certain groups to create upto (set amount of) preset replies in their UserCP that can then be selected whilst replying to a post. The presets can contain BBCode and a certain amount of characters which can be specified in ACP settings.</p>

Some of the plugins might not show in the list because I may have just recently updated the plugin. Just please wait a little bit for it to be approved.</p>
